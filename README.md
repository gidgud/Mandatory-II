6. Understands the basic hardware components of a computer system and the Von Neumann architecture.

Basic hardware components:
A computer has a CPU (brain), RAM (temporary memory), storage (permanent memory like SSD) and input/output devices (keyboard, monitor).

Von Neumann architecture:
Programs and data are stored together in the same memory.
The CPU fetches instructions from memory one by one, executes them and stores results back.
This design allows any program to run on the same hardware.

7. Knows about different types of databases and their use cases.

Relational Databases (SQL):
Structured tables, rows/columns, ACID transactions, SQL queries, relationships.
Banking, inventory systems, CRM - anywhere you need strict data consistency and complex relationships.

NoSQL Document Databases:
JSON-like documents, flexible schema, nested data.
Content management, user profiles, catalogs - when data structure varies or evolves frequently.

Key-Value Stores:
Simple lookups, blazing fast, cache, session storage.
Shopping carts, user sessions, real-time recommendations - need speed over complex queries.

Column-Family Databases:
Wide columns, time-series, massive scale, write-heavy.
IoT sensor data, analytics, event logging - huge volumes of writes with predictable access patterns.

Graph Databases:
Nodes, edges, relationships, traversal, connections.
Social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection - when relationships between data are as important as the data itself.

Time-Series Databases:
Timestamps, metrics, optimized for time-based queries, retention policies.
Monitoring systems, financial trading, IoT analytics - data points indexed by time.

In-Memory Databases:
RAM-based, microsecond latency, volatile/persistent options.
Real-time bidding, leaderboards, rate limiting - when milliseconds matter.



8. Can setup a new MySQL database and connect to it.

12. Can define Primary Keys.



13. Understands how Foreign Keys work.



14. In SELECT statements, can use (with moderate help):


        LIMIT, ORDER BY, GROUP BY

        aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX

        pattern matching with LIKE and wildcards

        JOIN to combine data from multiple tables



15. Can create inner, left and right joins after looking up the syntax.



16. Can create DDL statements to create tables with constraints: PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL.



17. Can create DML (UPDATE, DELETE) statements.



18. Can create a pull request.
